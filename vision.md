# Vision

## Project Vision

Autonomous Air Mobility (AAM) is progressing quickly in the UK, especially in Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations supporting emergency response, infrastructure inspection and time-critical logistics. While technical platforms mature, the governance arrangements that enable coordinated, accountable and transparent operations remain underdeveloped. Many organisations operate in conditions of institutional incompleteness: roles are fluid, documentation is bespoke, evidential reasoning varies and coordination often relies on situated judgement.

This project responds by treating governance not as a fixed structure but as something enacted through sociomaterial practices. The vision is intentionally modest and realistic: to strengthen the UK's capacity to understand and steward governance formation during emerging AAM/BVLOS services.

## Three Core Contributions

The project aims to deliver three contributions feasible within the 40-month award:

1. **Conceptual Clarity**: A clearer conceptual account of how governance is produced under uncertainty
2. **Organizational Capability**: Enhanced organizational capability to document decisions, coordinate actors and justify actions
3. **Empirical Insights**: Empirically grounded insights that inform analysis and decision-making

## Approach

The project examines governance as a process shaped by interactions between people, artefacts, digital systems and justificatory work. It focuses on concrete governance episodes—briefings, handovers, interpretation of rules, risk assessments, dashboard use and incident responses—observed at the Omnidrome Research & Innovation Centre (OD-RIC), a CAA-registered environment hosting BMT's SPARO BVLOS platform.

## Research Setting

Access includes real operational observations, documentation trails, decision logs and practitioner engagement. All technical operations remain entirely with BMT; the ESRC award supports only governance-relevant observation, analysis and translation, ensuring clear scope boundaries and protecting PI independence.

## Key Outputs

The project produces four outputs:

- **O1**: AAM Governance Trilemma (Journal Paper 1)
- **O2**: Governance Toolkit (responsibility maps, justificatory logs, data-flow templates and methods guidance)
- **O3**: Executive Report and Drone Futures exhibition assets
- **O4**: Journal Paper 2, Policy Brief and UKDS datasets

## Expected Outcomes

These outputs contribute to short-, mid- and late-term outcomes:

- **A1**: Improved conceptual understanding
- **E1**: Enhanced organizational capability
- **A2**: Validated models
- **E2**: Early embedding
- **A3**: Consolidated theory
- **E3**: Policy-relevant insights

Longer-term effects are treated as plausible but contingent pathways.

## PI Development

The project builds on the PI's prior ESRC SSIA award on responsible AAM, strengthening engagement capability. It advances the PI's leadership through integrated conceptual, empirical and organizational contributions.

## Summary

Overall, this project provides tightly scoped, evidence-led foundations for strengthening governance in the early development of AAM/BVLOS services in the UK.
