# Governing Autonomous Air Mobility

**ESRC New Investigator Award - Proto-Institutional Governance of Advanced Air Mobility**

---

## Project Overview

**Version:** v5.4 (Canonical, No-Simulation)  
**Award Type:** ESRC New Investigator Award  
**Duration:** 40 months (June 2026 - October 2029)  
**PI:** Dr. Pol Stavros, Royal Holloway, University of London

### Research Question

How is governance accomplished in early AAM/BVLOS operations, where actors rely on dynamic actor-artefact-algorithm-rule configurations to coordinate safely and legitimately?

### Core Problem

UK AAM deployment faces a **governance trilemma**—balancing innovation velocity, public safety, and democratic accountability. Current approaches lack mechanism-level understanding of cross-actor dependencies, practice-tested toolkits, and evidence linking governance choices to sector outcomes.

## Key Outputs & Outcomes

### Outputs (O1-O4)

| Output | Description | Milestone |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **O1** | AAM Governance Trilemma - Journal Paper 1 | M12 |
| **O2** | Governance Toolkit & Methods Guide | M24 |
| **O3** | Executive Report + Drone Futures Exhibition | M32 |
| **O4** | Journal Paper 2 + Policy Brief + UKDS Dataset | M40 |

### Outcomes

**Short-term (0-18m)**
- **A1**: Improved conceptual understanding
- **E1**: Enhanced cross-sector capacity

**Mid-term (18-36m)**
- **A2**: Validated adaptive governance models
- **E2**: Early partner uptake

**Late-term (36-40m+)**
- **A3**: Consolidated theory
- **E3**: Policy-relevant insights

## Work Packages

### WP1: Governance Episodes & Mechanisms (M1-12)
**Lead:** PI | **Output:** O1 | **Outcome:** A1

Construct rich governance episodes from live BVLOS operations at OD-RIC/BMT SPARO using three-layer coding.

### WP2: Toolkit Encoding (M12-24)
**Lead:** RIA (1.0 FTE) | **Output:** O2 | **Outcome:** E1

Translate mechanisms into practical toolkit: responsibility maps, justificatory logs, data-flow templates.

### WP3: Evaluation & Validation (M18-32)
**Lead:** PI, PcL (0.10 FTE) | **Output:** O3 | **Outcomes:** A2, E2

Validate through partner trials, breakdown analysis, and Drone Futures exhibition.

### WP4: Translation & Legacy (M32-40)
**Lead:** PI, PcL | **Output:** O4 | **Outcomes:** A3, E3

Synthesize into policy formats. Prepare FAIR datasets for UKDS/ReShare.

## Theory of Change

**IF** rich governance episodes constructed (WP1)  
**AND** mechanisms encoded into toolkit (WP2)  
**AND** validated through trials + evaluation (WP3)  
**AND** translated into policy formats (WP4)

**THEN** stakeholders gain validated governance options  
**LEADING TO** sector legitimacy & translation readiness  
**ENABLING** responsible AAM deployment (3-10 years post-award)
