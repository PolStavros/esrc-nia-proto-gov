# Outputs & Outcomes

This page provides the complete mapping between project outputs (O1-O4) and outcomes (A1-A3, E1-E3, S1-S2), showing how deliverables translate into conceptual, organizational and societal impacts.

## Complete Outputs-Outcomes Mapping

### O1 → A1

**Output O1 (M12): AAM Governance Trilemma - Journal Paper 1**

- Peer-reviewed conceptual framework in governance/innovation journal
- Mechanism taxonomy with worked UK case examples
- Public goods framing: safety-innovation-legitimacy tensions

**Leads to Outcome A1 (M12-18): Improved Conceptual Understanding**

- Stakeholders (regulators, operators, academics) can articulate mechanism-level dynamics
- Indicator: 75%+ workshop participants correctly apply framework to novel scenarios
- Beneficiaries: Academic researchers, ARPAS-UK members, BMT/SkyBound staff
