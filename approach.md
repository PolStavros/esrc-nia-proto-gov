# Research Approach

## Overview of Research Design

This project provides a rigorous account of how governance takes shape during the early development of Autonomous Air Mobility (AAM) and Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations. Despite growing technical capability, governance practices remain provisional. Organisations make decisions under conditions of institutional incompleteness: roles are fluid, evidential expectations are variable, and coordination often relies on informal routines.

The research adopts a **longitudinal, qualitative and abductive design** grounded in process-relational analysis. It will be conducted at the Omnidrome Research & Innovation Centre (OD-RIC), a CAA-registered environment hosting BMT's SPARO BVLOS platform.

All technical flights are funded and executed by BMT; ESRC resources support only the governance-relevant observation, coding, interpretation and translation activities.

## Theoretical and Analytical Framework

The project uses a **process-relational ontology**, viewing governance as an outcome of sociomaterial practices rather than a predefined institutional structure.

### Three Core Constructs

1. **Relational infrastructures**: Temporary alignments of people, artefacts, systems and justificatory practices that stabilise coordination
2. **Practices of coordination and justification**: Situated actions through which actors interpret requirements, assign responsibilities and manage uncertainty
3. **Adaptive governance mechanisms**: Recurring sociomaterial patterns explaining how governance emerges, adapts or fails

---

## Research Setting and Access

OD-RIC provides structured, repeatable access to BVLOS operations. Access includes:

- Live operational observations
- Documentation (flight plans, SOPs, risk assessments, logs)
- Telemetry and dashboard outputs relevant for governance analysis
- Semi-structured time with operators, engineers, managers
- Interactions with local authorities and emergency services

**Independence safeguard**: All technical operations by BMT; ESRC supports governance analysis only.

## Methods and Data Collection

### 4.1 Governance Episode Construction

Governance episodes are moments where coordination, accountability or justification work becomes visible. Episodes are extracted from observation notes, operational logs and documentation using **temporal bracketing** to capture sequences, interdependencies and breakdowns.

### 4.2 Three-Layer Coding (C1-C3)

- **C1 - Processual-temporal**: Sequences, dependencies, turning points
- **C2 - Relational-sociomaterial**: Interactions among actors, artefacts, dataflows, digital systems
- **C3 - Justificatory-reflexive**: How actors articulate and justify decisions

### 4.3 Abductive Mechanism Derivation

Mechanisms are derived iteratively by comparing episodes across time, contexts and organisations. Candidate mechanisms are retained when they demonstrate:
- Recurrence across cases
- Explanatory strength
- Practitioner recognisability

### 4.4 Interviews and Co-Interpretation

Semi-structured interviews with operators, engineers, managers, local authority representatives and emergency services practitioners complement observational data. Co-interpretation sessions verify analytic insights and validate toolkit components.

### 4.5 Public Engagement (KE3)

The Drone Futures exhibition provides structured insight into public perceptions of AAM governance using pre/post instruments, interaction logs and mini-interviews.

## Work Packages

### WP1: Governance Episodes and Mechanisms (Months 1-12)
**Leads**: PI (analysis), Technician (data governance)  
**Output**: O1 (Drone Trilemma paper)  
**Outcome**: A1 (improved conceptual understanding)

**Tasks**:
1. Observations and documentation review
2. Episode construction and temporal bracketing
3. Three-layer coding (C1-C3)
4. Mechanism derivation
5. KE1 co-production workshop

WP1 establishes the empirical and analytic foundation for the entire project.

### WP2: Governance Toolkit Development (Months 12-24)
**Leads**: RIA (1.0 FTE), PI (analytic oversight)  
**Output**: O2 (Governance Toolkit & Methods Guide)  
**Outcome**: E1 (enhanced organisational capability)

Translates mechanisms into practical artefacts:
- Responsibility maps
- Justificatory logs
- Data-flow templates
- Evidence-documentation tools

**Iteration cycle**: prototype → test → review → revision

### WP3: Evaluation and Embedding (Months 18-32)
**Leads**: PI, PcL (0.10 FTE)  
**Output**: O3 (Executive Report & Exhibition Assets)  
**Outcomes**: A2, E2, S1

Assesses mechanism performance across organisations, examines breakdown cases, tracks light-touch adjustments indicating early embedding (SOPs, templates, dashboards).

**KE3**: Drone Futures exhibition provides legitimacy evidence via public evaluation.

### WP4: Policy Translation and Legacy (Months 32-40)
**Leads**: PI, PcL  
**Output**: O4 (White Paper, Journal Paper 2, UKDS repository)  
**Outcomes**: A3, E3, S2

Synthesises insights into policy-accessible formats. Produces FAIR-compliant datasets and codebooks for UKDS/ReShare.

---

## Alignment with Objectives and Outcomes

The Approach is fully aligned with the Theory of Change:

- WP1 → O1 → A1
- WP2 → O2 → E1
- WP3 → O3 → A2 / E2 / S1
- WP4 → O4 → A3 / E3 / S2

This ensures vertical traceability from activities to outcomes.

## Engagement and Impact Pathways

Engagement is embedded throughout:

- **KE1**: Co-production (access, focus, ethical grounding)
- **KE2**: Practitioner review (feasibility, burden)
- **KE3**: Public legitimacy evaluation
- **KE4**: Policy briefings aligned with AMS / CAP cycles

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Access variability | Multiple partners; contingencies documented |
| Data sensitivity | Technician oversight; robust anonymisation |
| Analytic overload | Episode sampling; staged coding; advisory review |
| Policy timing | Alignment with ongoing processes, not fixed milestones |

---

## Research Environment

Royal Holloway provides an appropriate environment for sociomaterial governance research, with strengths in qualitative methods, digital innovation and public-sector engagement. Strong data governance, ethics support and professional development.

---

## Career Development

The project provides clear route for PI transition to independent leadership. PI retains intellectual control over theory, methods, analysis and major outputs. Partnerships enhance applied relevance without diluting independence.

---

## Data Management and Ethics

DMP meets ESRC requirements: clear data types, formats, volumes, anonymisation, FAIR documentation, secure storage, version control and repository archiving (UKDS/ReShare).

Telemetry and operational artefacts are pseudonymised; sensitive content managed under institutional ethical protocols.
